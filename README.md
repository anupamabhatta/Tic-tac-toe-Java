# **Tic-Tac-Toe in Java**

## **Description**

This repository contains a Java implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game. Developed as part of a final assignment for Programming II, the game provides an engaging 2-player experience where players alternate marking spaces on a 3x3 grid. The goal is to align three marks (either X or O) horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to win.

## **Features**

- **2-Player Mode**: Supports two players taking turns to play.
- **Game Grid**: A simple 3x3 grid for players to mark their moves.
- **Algorithm Library**: Custom algorithm library (`TicTacToeAlgorithm.jar`) used to control the game logic.
- **JavaDoc Documentation**: Detailed documentation available for understanding the code structure and functions.

## **Getting Started**

To play the game:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g., **NetBeans**).
3. The game code is located in the **`src/`** folder.
4. The **`lib/AlgorithmLibrary/`** folder contains the algorithm library used in the game, and the **`TicTacToeAlgorithm.jar`** file is an executable JAR for the game logic.
5. Compile and run the Java files to start the game.

Simply open the project in your IDE and run the game.

## **Technologies Used**

- **Java**: The programming language used for implementing the game.
- **NetBeans**: IDE used for development.
- **JavaDoc**: For documenting the gameâ€™s source code.
- **TicTacToeAlgorithm.jar**: Custom algorithm library used in the game for game logic.

## **File Structure**

- **`lib/AlgorithmLibrary/`**: Folder containing the algorithm library used in the game.
- **`nbproject/`**: Folder containing NetBeans project files.
- **`src/`**: Folder containing the source code files for the game.
- **`.DS_Store`**: macOS system file (can be ignored).
- **`README.md`**: Documentation file with project details and instructions.
- **`build.xml`**: Ant build script for compiling and building the project.
- **`manifest.mf`**: Manifest file specifying metadata for the project.

## **Usage**

1. Open the project in your preferred IDE, such as **NetBeans**.
2. Navigate to the **`src/`** folder for the main game files.
3. Compile and run the Java files to launch the game.
4. Players take turns marking a spot on the 3x3 grid.
5. The first player to align three marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.
